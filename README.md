# MS_miRNA_mRNA

Our project is designed to contribute on investigating a promising diagnostic model which may be constructed as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients of 4 different stages of MS disease in terms of miRNA and mRNA targets, hoping to contribute to early diagnosis of MS through the blood specifically in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). 
Diagnostic models are constructed based on differential miRNAs and mRNAs. Then, Q-RT-PCR will be used to validate the expression of selected DE mRNAs and DE miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). This provides a new promising direction to construct guide more effective diagnostic and prognostic strategies of MS.
The First part of our study is searching for miRNA and mRNA appropriate expression datasets in GEO (NCBI) and Expression Atlas (EMBL) to identify differential expressed candidate miRNAs and mRNA in any samples of MS patients including 4 different stages.
