 With bash you can use "grep" to take only the human miRNAs from the fasta file.

grep "Homo sapiens" mature.fa -A 1 | grep -v "\--" > only_human_mirna.fa

The -A 1 argument allow us to extract one line after the matching line with the given pattern.

If you are working with miRDeep2 you can follow this command line;

perl extract_miRNAs.pl mature.fa has mature > mature.hsa.fa

you only need to change the tree letter code, in this case hsa stand for human.

You can also convert the file to DNA with

perl rna2dna.pl mature.hsa.fa > mature.hsa.dna.fa

ItÂ´s the same for the hairpin sequences

perl extract_miRNAs.pl hairpin.fa hsa> hairpin.hsa.fa

perl rna2dna.pl hairpin.hsa.fa > hairpin.hsa.dna.fa
