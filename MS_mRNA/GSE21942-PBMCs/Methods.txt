Human U133 Plus 2.0 GeneChip array CEL data were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [42].
 When computing power allows, the data were processed with AffyPLM [43] 
using its three-step procedure of processing background signals with GCRMA,
 normalizing signals with quantile normalization, and summarize probe signals with medium polish.
 For large experimental datasets that were computationally infeasible for us,
 we used justRMA from the Affy package [44]. For experimental dataset without raw CEL data, 
we obtained the pre-processed matrix files via GEOQuery [45]. 
Regardless of the source of array signal processing, we analyzed the genes for differential expression with Limma [46].
Differentially expressed gene candidates with p-value < 0.05 and logFC > 1.0 were selected and crossed with genes 
from EST profiling with statistical evaluation. 
For each array, the significant genes were crossed with our EST profiling results. 
The union of these intersecting genes was selected for further evaluation.
